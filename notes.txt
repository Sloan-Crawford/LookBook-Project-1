=== Bootstrap ===
b4 in index.html creates a biolerplate bootstrap template that includes links to Bootstrap CSS stylesheet, jQuery, Popper.js, and Bootstrap JS.
think about the layout of the webpage - a two column layout with a logo, cards, search box, etc.
bootstrap uses a grid system that always consists of 12 columns 
so to make a 2 column layout, both must add to a total of 12 (i.e., 8 + 4)
cards are controls used inside of bootstrap to layout content 
cards have headers, bodies, and can have footers
classes built into bootstrap CSS that I'm using include mb-4, card-header, card-body, text-muted, etc

=== JS ===

 XPathResult.open("GET", url, true)
 // run as an asynchronous request on a different thread

 xhr.send(); 
 // initiates network traffic (gets file from server)

readystate can run 4 numbers (I want to trigger a function when file is done loading)...
0 = unsent, 1 = document is open, 2 = received headers/info, 3 = loading file back, 4 = done

xhr.status == 200
// means the transaction/request is ok

document.getElementById("fileContent").innerHTML = currentBook;
// at this point I have successfully loaded the file from disc(server), streamed it back through HTTP and placed it in the website dynamically and changed the innerHTML content.
