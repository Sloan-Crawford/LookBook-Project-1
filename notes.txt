=== Bootstrap ===

b4 in index.html creates a biolerplate bootstrap template that includes links to Bootstrap CSS stylesheet, jQuery, Popper.js, and Bootstrap JS.
think about the layout of the webpage - a two column layout with a logo, cards, search box, etc.
bootstrap uses a grid system that always consists of 12 columns 
so to make a 2 column layout, both must add to a total of 12 (i.e., 8 + 4)
cards are controls used inside of bootstrap to layout content 
cards have headers, bodies, and can have footers
classes built into bootstrap CSS that I'm using include mb-4, card-header, card-body, text-muted, etc

How to make HTTP requests using XMLHttpRequest (XHR):
https://attacomsian.com/blog/http-requests-xhr

 XPathResult.open("GET", url, true)
 // run as an asynchronous request on a different thread

 xhr.send(); 
 // initiates network traffic (gets file from server)

readystate can run 4 numbers (I want to trigger a function when file is done loading)...
0 = unsent, 1 = document is open, 2 = received headers/info, 3 = loading file back, 4 = done

xhr.status == 200
// means the transaction/request is ok

document.getElementById("fileContent").innerHTML = currentBook;
// at this point I have successfully loaded the file from disc(server), streamed it back through HTTP and placed it in the website dynamically and changed the innerHTML content.

elmnt.scrollTop = 0;
// scrolls the viewer to the top


I need to parse the file to remove things in the text files like carriage returns, line breaks, etc.
To do this I used a regular expression:
currentBook = currentBook.replace(/(?:\r\n|\r|\n)/g, '<br>');  //the g means do it globally

When counting every word in the wordArray, the for loop will add the word to the dictionary every time it finds one and keep incrementing over the value of it, adding 1 to its value each time.
